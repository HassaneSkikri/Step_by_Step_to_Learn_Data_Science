## DAY 22 :

### Topic: Steps in Machine Learning Project

- Define the Problem: Identify the problem you want to solve and determine if machine learning can be used to solve it.
- Collect Data: Gather and clean the data that you will use to train your model. The quality of your model will depend on the quality of your data.
- Explore the Data: Use data visualization and statistical methods to understand the structure and relationships within your data.
- Pre-process the Data: Prepare the data for modeling by normalizing, transforming, and cleaning it as necessary.
- Split the Data: Divide the data into training and test datasets to validate your model.
- Choose a Model: Select a machine learning model that is appropriate for your problem and the data you have collected.
- Train the Model: Use the training data to train the model, adjusting its parameters to fit the data as accurately as possible.
- Evaluate the Model: Use the test data to evaluate the performance of the model and determine its accuracy.
- Fine-tune the Model: Based on the results of the evaluation, fine-tune the model by adjusting its parameters and repeating the training process until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.
