We will discover:

1. Basic Example: A simple example using Scikit-Learn for machine learning.
2. Data Loading: Guidelines on data requirements and loading techniques.
3. Model Fitting: Instructions for fitting both supervised and unsupervised learning models.
4. Prediction: Methods to make predictions using different estimators.
5. Data Preprocessing: Techniques for standardization, normalization, binarization, and encoding categorical features.
6. Model Creation: Steps to create supervised and unsupervised learning estimators.
7. Model Evaluation: Various metrics for assessing the performance of models.
8. Model Tuning: Strategies for tuning models using grid search and randomized parameter optimization.
