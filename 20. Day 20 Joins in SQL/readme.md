[**Project to practice**](https://github.com/HassaneSkikri/Analyse_Covide19_with_SQL_Tableau)
first download the dataset [here](https://github.com/HassaneSkikri/Analyse_Covide19_with_SQL_Tableau/tree/main/data) than try to practice all the SQL Queries in the readme file, after this you can see the correction [here](https://github.com/HassaneSkikri/Analyse_Covide19_with_SQL_Tableau/blob/main/SQLQuery.sql)

Don't focus on the Tableau section; we will delve into it in the previous lessons.
